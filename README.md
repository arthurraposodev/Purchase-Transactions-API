| [ExchangeRateServiceImpl.java](https://github.com/kaireaver/purchase-transactions-api/blob/main/src/main/java/company/purchases/service/impl/ExchangeRateServiceImpl.java)         | The code is an implementation of the ExchangeRateService interface. It provides a method called "updateExchangeRates" which retrieves the latest exchange rates from an API, saves them to a repository, and handles any errors that occur during the process. The method uses resilience4j libraries to handle circuit breaking, rate limiting, and retrying. The exchange rates are retrieved using a WebClient and are processed asynchronously using reactive programming with Reactor. The method logs the progress and status of the update process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [ExchangeRateServiceImplTest.java](https://github.com/kaireaver/purchase-transactions-api/blob/main/src/test/java/company/purchases/service/impl/ExchangeRateServiceImplTest.java) | The code is a test class `ExchangeRateServiceImplTest` that contains several test methods for the `ExchangeRateServiceImpl` class. The first test method `retrieveLatestRecordDateAndStartFromNextDayTest` verifies that the `updateExchangeRates` method retrieves the latest record date from the `ExchangeRateRepository` and starts from the next day if records exist.The second test method `startFromTenYearsAgoIfNoRecordsExistTest` verifies that if no records exist, the `updateExchangeRates` method starts from 10 years ago.The third test method `retrieveExchangeRatesFromApiUsingWebClientTest` verifies that the `updateExchangeRates` method retrieves exchange rates from the API using `WebClient`.The fourth test method `test_exchangeRateRepositoryReturnsEmptyMonoTest` verifies that if the `ExchangeRateRepository` returns an empty `Mono`, the `updateExchangeRates` method still executes without errors.The fifth test method `webClientReturnsEmptyMonoTest` verifies that if the `WebClient` returns an empty `Mono`, the `updateExchangeRates` method still executes without errors.The sixth test method `webClientReturnsExchangeRateResponseWithEmptyDataListTest` verifies that if the `WebClient` returns an `ExchangeRateResponse` with an empty data list, the `updateExchangeRates` method still executes without errors. |
| [TransactionServiceImplTest.java](https://github.com/kaireaver/purchase-transactions-api/blob/main/src/test/java/company/purchases/service/impl/TransactionServiceImplTest.java)   | The code includes a test class named TransactionServiceImplTest, which contains several test methods. These test methods validate the functionalities of a TransactionServiceImpl class, which implements a service for handling transactions. The test methods cover different scenarios, such as retrieving a transaction with a converted amount, retrieving a transaction by its ID, saving a transaction, rounding the amount of a transaction, and retrieving all transactions from a repository. The test methods use mocking with the help of Mockito to simulate interactions with the repository and mapper dependencies of the TransactionServiceImpl. They also use StepVerifier to verify the correctness of the results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| [ExchangeRateClientHealth.java](https://github.com/kaireaver/purchase-transactions-api/blob/main/src/main/java/company/purchases/health/ExchangeRateClientHealth.java)         | The code above is the implementation of a health check for an Exchange Rate Client in a purchases application. It utilizes the Spring Boot Actuator framework to create a ReactiveHealthIndicator. The ExchangeRateClientHealth class makes a GET request to a specific API endpoint and checks the response status. If the status is OK (200), it returns an "up" status indicating the client is healthy. Otherwise, it returns a "down" status with additional details about the response status. The health check is performed asynchronously using a WebClient. |

| [ExchangeRateJobTest.java](https://github.com/kaireaver/purchase-transactions-api/blob/main/src/test/java/company/purchases/job/ExchangeRateJobTest.java) | The code is a test suite for the ExchangeRateJob class. It tests the functionality of the updateRates method in three scenarios:1. updateRatesCallsUpdateExchangeRatesTest: This test verifies that when the updateRates method is called, it invokes the updateExchangeRates method of an ExchangeRateService object.2. updateRatesExecutedEvery5SecondsTest: This test ensures that the updateRates method is executed every 5 seconds by using a ScheduledExecutorService. It waits for 5 seconds and then checks that the updateExchangeRates method has been called at least 5 times.3. exchangeRateJobAnnotatedWithComponentTest: This test confirms that the ExchangeRateJob class is annotated with @Component.4. updateRatesThrowsNullPointerExceptionWhenExchangeRateServiceIsNullTest: This test validates that if the ExchangeRateService object is null, the updateRates method throws a NullPointerException. |

It extends the "ReactiveCrudRepository" interface, which provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The repository is responsible for managing "Transaction" entities and is annotated with "@Repository" to indicate that it is a Spring component. The "Transaction" entity is identified by a "Long" ID.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [ExchangeRateRepository.java](https://github.com/kaireaver/purchase-transactions-api/blob/main/src/main/java/company/purchases/repository/ExchangeRateRepository.java) | The code provided defines a Java interface called ExchangeRateRepository, which is a repository for managing ExchangeRate objects. It extends the ReactiveCrudRepository interface, which provides generic CRUD operations for reactive data access. The repository includes two query methods: findLatestRecordDate, which retrieves the latest record date from the exchange_rates table, and findByCurrencyAndRecordDateMinusSixMonths, which retrieves the most recent exchange rate for a given currency within the last six months. Both methods return Mono objects, indicating that the results will be emitted asynchronously. |
